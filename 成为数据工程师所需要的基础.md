#### Chapter 3 

We’d like to expand or elaborate on these pillars with
these principles of data engineering architecture:

1. Choose common components wisely.
2. Plan for failure.
3. Architect for scalability.
4. Architecture is leadership.
5. Always be architecting.
6. Build loosely coupled systems.
7. Make reversible decisions.
8. Prioritize security.
9. Embrace FinOps.

作者提出了构建数据工程中的几个所必须的原则：选择通用的组件，为失败做好打算，使用可扩展的架构，使用具有代表性的架构，建造松耦合的系统，让做出的决定可以回退，优先考虑安全，拥抱FinOps。



Recovery time objective
The maximum acceptable time for a service or system outage. The recovery time objective (RTO) is generally set by determining the business impact of an outage. An RTO of one day might be fine for an internal reporting system. A website outage of just five minutes could have a significant adverse business impact on an online retailer.  

RTO(Recovery time objective)又称恢复时间目标，是一个系统或服务中断的最长可接收时间。



Recovery point objective
The acceptable state after recovery. In data systems, data is often lost during an outage. In this setting, the recovery point objective (RPO) refers to the maximum acceptable data loss.  

RPO(Recovery point objective)又称恢复点目标，是恢复后能接受的状态，且可接收的数据损失。



#### Chapter 5

OLTP systems are less suited to use cases driven by analytics at scale, where a single query must scan a vast amount of data.

OLTP系统不适用于可扩展分析型架构，因为单个查询必须扫描大量数据。



Consistency means that any database read will return the last written version of the retrieved item. Isolation entails that if two updates are in flight concurrently for the same thing, the end database state will be consistent with the sequential execution of these updates in the order they were submitted. Durability indicates that committed data will never be lost, even in the event of power loss.  

事务型数据库的四个特性。



Database logs are essential enough that they deserve more detailed coverage. Writeahead logs—typically, binary files stored in a specific database-native format—play a crucial role in database guarantees and recoverability.   

预写日志是以特定数据库存储的二进制文件，在数据库保证和可恢复性中扮演重要角色。



A database system used to store and serve data. Abbreviated as DBMS, it consists of a storage engine, query optimizer, disaster recovery, and other key components for managing the database system.  

DMBS即数据库管理系统，通常由存储引擎，查询优化器，灾备恢复，和其他关键组件所组成。



#### Chapter 6

#### Solid-State Drive  

Because of these exceptional performance characteristics, SSDs have revolutionized
transactional databases and are the accepted standard for commercial deployments of
OLTP systems. SSDs allow relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL
Server to handle thousands of transactions per second.  

SSD固态硬盘允许关系型数据库PostgreSQL，MySQL等每秒处理上千个事务。



#### Chapter 8

#### Row Explosion  

An obscure but frustrating problem is row explosion. This occurs when we have a large number of many-to-many matches, either because of repetition in join keys or as a consequence of join logic.   

当我们有一个大量的多对多匹配时，或者大量的重复的关键字连接时会导致“行爆炸”。



Codd introduced the idea of normal forms. The normal forms are sequential, with each form incorporating the conditions of prior forms. We describe Codd’s first three normal forms here:
Denormalized
No normalization. Nested and redundant data is allowed.
First normal form (1NF)
Each column is unique and has a single value. The table has a unique primary
key.
Second normal form (2NF)
The requirements of 1NF, plus partial dependencies are removed.
Third normal form (3NF)
The requirements of 2NF, plus each table contains only relevant fields related to
its primary key and has no transitive dependencies.
